## Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Understanding greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for developing effective policies and strategies. This repository provides tools to forecast emissions, helping researchers and policymakers make informed decisions.

## Project Overview

This project integrates two powerful forecasting methods: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). ARIMA is a traditional statistical approach, while LSTM is a deep learning technique. By combining these methods, we aim to leverage their strengths for better prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to download the necessary files and execute them. You can find the latest releases here: [Download Releases](https://github.com/MPB0828/Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-Forecasting-with-ARIMA-LSTM/releases).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib

## Data Sources

Accurate forecasting relies on quality data. This project uses publicly available datasets on greenhouse gas emissions. You can find the datasets in the `data` folder of this repository. Feel free to explore and use them for your analysis.

## Modeling Techniques

### ARIMA

ARIMA is a popular method for time series forecasting. It captures the temporal dependencies in the data. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:

1. **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Uses the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
2. **Integrated (I)**: Involves differencing the raw observations to make the time series stationary.
3. **Moving Average (MA)**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model.

### LSTM

LSTM networks are designed to learn from sequences of data. They are particularly effective for time series forecasting due to their ability to remember long-term dependencies. Key features include:

- **Memory Cells**: Store information for long periods.
- **Gates**: Control the flow of information in and out of the cells.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn statsmodels tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

After setting up your environment, you can run the models. The main script is located in the `src` folder. Execute the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will generate forecasts based on the input data. Make sure to adjust the configuration settings in the script as needed.

## Results

The results of the forecasting will be displayed in the console. You can also visualize the predictions using matplotlib. Graphs will show the actual emissions versus the predicted values, providing insights into the model's performance.
